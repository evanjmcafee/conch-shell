# Conch-Shell
I thought I should share this project instead of keeping it confiden-shell.
## Summary
I gave it that name because it lets you listen to the system like a seashell lets you listen to the ocean. This is the code for my shell project for Eastern University's "Operating Systems" course. I think this software is pretty nice but I wont brag because I dont want to make anybody shellous. I think my jokes are shellarious.

## Features
- cd.. instead of cd ..
- direct copy-paste

## Compile 
gcc main.c -o conch -Wall
